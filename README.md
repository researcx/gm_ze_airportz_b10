# gm_ze_airportz_b10

I made this map a while ago with help from [Black Phoenix](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197982559015/) (teleports, optimizing forest, landing strip in the forest).

What makes this map special is that each side of it teleports you, so therefore, you can keep flying forever! There are just so many possibilities (or well, that's what we found out) with this that it won't get boring fast.

Mind you, this map is still unfinished originally (note the b10).
